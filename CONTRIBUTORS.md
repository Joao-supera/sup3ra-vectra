## Attribution & Co-Authorship Policy (Clear and Fair)

SUP3RA VECTRA™ aims for transparent credit.

- **Public credit**: All accepted PRs and validated test results will be acknowledged here.
- **Paper co-authorship**: Offered when contributions meet typical research standards, such as:
  - substantial experimental work (new model validations, benchmark suites, or analysis)
  - meaningful engineering contributions (core logic, tests, tooling)
  - major writing/review contributions (spec, methodology, reports)

Co-authorship is **not automatic** for minor edits, but **public acknowledgement always is**.
