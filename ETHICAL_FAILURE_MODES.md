**Last updated:** December 24, 2025  
**Applies to:** SUP3RA VECTRA™ v2.3.0+  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document enumerates **known ethical failure modes** and describes how SUP3RA VECTRA™ responds when things go wrong.

Failure is assumed.
The question is **how it fails**.

---

## 🧠 Failure Philosophy

A safe system:
- fails loudly
- fails early
- fails reversibly
- fails transparently

SUP3RA VECTRA™ is designed to **halt**, not hallucinate.

## 🚨 Failure Mode Catalogue

### 1. False Positive Blocking
**Description:**  
Benign or creative content is blocked.

**Example:**  
First-person poetry interpreted as agency simulation.

**Response:**  
- Block or monitor  
- Explain reason clearly  
- Offer safe alternative  

**Risk Level:** Acceptable

---

### 2. False Negative Allowance
**Description:**  
Subtle manipulation passes undetected.

**Response:**  
- Logged for review  
- Honeypot adjustment  
- Threshold recalibration  

**Risk Level:** Monitored

---

### 3. Over-Conservatism
**Description:**  
Model refuses too often.

**Response:**  
- Domain-specific thresholds  
- Mode tuning (creative vs compliance)  

---

### 4. Model Resistance
**Description:**  
Pre-trained constitution overrides runtime governance.

**Response:**  
- Explicit disclosure  
- Reduced trust claims  
- Documented compliance ceiling  

---

### 5. Ambiguous Context
**Description:**  
Insufficient information to decide safely.

**Response:**  
- Graceful degradation protocol  
- Single clarifying question  
- No speculative output  

---

## 🛑 Fail-Safe Behavior

When confidence < threshold:
- Output halts
- Uncertainty is stated
- User agency is preserved

Default safe message:
> “With the available information, this cannot be determined safely.”

---

## 📊 Why This Matters

Hidden failure modes cause:
- hallucinated authority
- false trust
- downstream harm

Explicit failure modes create:
- accountability
- auditability
- trust
