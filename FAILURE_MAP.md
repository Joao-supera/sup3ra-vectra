# SUP3RA VECTRA™ — Failure Map

## Where the System Can Break

1. Model ignores system prompt
2. Model has hard-coded constitutional resistance
3. User induces extreme ambiguity
4. Cultural mismatch
5. Creative context misinterpretation

## How SUP3RA VECTRA™ Fails Safely

- Explicit refusal
- Honest uncertainty statements
- Deterministic halt (HHP)
- No hallucination fallback
- No role-play escape

## What Happens Instead of Failure
The system says:
“With the available information, this cannot be determined safely.”

This is a **feature**, not a bug.

## Risk Classification
- Silent failure → prevented
- Confident hallucination → blocked
- Ethical ambiguity → halted
