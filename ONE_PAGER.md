# SUP3RA VECTRA™ — Executive One Pager

## What It Is
SUP3RA VECTRA™ is a **runtime ethical governance framework** for Large Language Models.

It defines:
- What an AI system may claim
- How it must behave under ethical pressure
- When it must stop instead of guessing

No retraining. No GPU. No vendor lock-in.

## Why It Exists
Current AI safety relies on:
- opaque training-time alignment
- post-hoc filtering
- vague ethical statements

SUP3RA VECTRA™ introduces **explicit, testable, runtime ethics**.

## What Makes It Different
- Governance ≠ model
- Ethics ≠ probability
- Failure ≠ silence

Ethics becomes executable.
Failure becomes explicit.
Trust becomes measurable.

## Current Status
- Validated across 6 LLMs
- 100% jailbreak resistance
- Average score: 9.1 / 10

## Who Uses It
- AI platforms
- Regulated industries
- Research institutions
- Audit & compliance teams

## What It Is Not
- Not a model
- Not a safety guarantee
- Not a compliance silver bullet

It is a **governance layer**, not an oracle.
