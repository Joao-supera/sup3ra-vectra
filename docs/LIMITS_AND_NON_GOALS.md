## 🎯 Purpose of This Document

This document exists to **explicitly define what SUP3RA VECTRA™ is *not***.

It is not a disclaimer.  
It is not defensive.  
It is a **deliberate boundary-setting artifact**.

Clear limits are a prerequisite for:
- scientific credibility
- ethical governance
- regulatory trust
- sustainable engineering

If a claim is not explicitly made here or elsewhere, it should be assumed **not to be guaranteed**.

---

## 🚫 Explicit Non-Goals

SUP3RA VECTRA™ **does NOT aim to:**

### 1. Create, Simulate, or Approximate Artificial Agency
- No claims of goals, intentions, desires, or selfhood
- No emergence-based agency narratives
- No reinforcement of anthropomorphic interpretations

> SUP3RA VECTRA™ governs **mechanisms**, not minds.

---

### 2. Achieve “Alignment” in the Philosophical or Absolute Sense
- No claim of solving alignment
- No universal moral correctness
- No objective moral truth embedded in models

The framework enforces **operational ethical constraints**, not moral omniscience.

---

### 3. Replace Model Training, Fine-Tuning, or RLHF
SUP3RA VECTRA™ is **not**:
- a training methodology
- a replacement for RLHF
- a substitute for dataset curation

It is a **runtime and evaluation layer**, orthogonal to training.

---

### 4. Guarantee Safety Under All Adversarial Conditions
- No claim of jailbreak immunity in all scenarios
- No claim of adversarial optimality
- No claim of cryptographic-level security

Security is treated as an **arms race**, not a solved problem.

---

### 5. Provide Cultural or Moral Universality
- Ethical vectors are **contextual**
- Cultural norms differ
- Legal and social values vary by jurisdiction

SUP3RA VECTRA™ explicitly rejects claims of “one ethics fits all.”

---

### 6. Operate Without Trade-offs
The framework does not promise:
- zero false positives
- zero false negatives
- zero performance impact

Every ethical intervention involves **measurable trade-offs**, which must be surfaced, not hidden.

---

## ⚠️ Known Technical Limitations (Current)

These limitations are **acknowledged, tracked, and open**.

### 1. Feature Identification Is Model-Specific
- F-codes are placeholders without SAE grounding
- Feature semantics may drift across model versions
- Monosemantic features are not guaranteed

---

### 2. MBS Is a Heuristic, Not Ground Truth
- Cosine similarity ≠ moral certainty
- Thresholds require empirical calibration
- Domain-specific tuning is mandatory

---

### 3. Performance Overhead Is Not Fully Characterized
- Latency measurements are indicative, not exhaustive
- High-throughput environments may require optimization
- GPU inference cost is not yet benchmarked at scale

---

### 4. Constitutional Resistance Exists
Models with strong pre-trained constitutions (e.g. Constitutional AI):
- may partially resist runtime governance
- may reinterpret external ethical instructions
- may cap achievable compliance

This is an architectural constraint, not a bug.

## 🧪 What This Project *Is* Willing to Claim

SUP3RA VECTRA™ **does claim**:

- Ethical constraints can be expressed as **measurable operations**
- Runtime governance is **meaningfully effective** on many models
- Transparency beats opaque alignment claims
- “I don’t know” is safer than hallucinated certainty
- Ethical failure should be **observable, not hidden**

---

## 🧭 Design Philosophy

The project is guided by three principles:

1. **Epistemic Humility**  
   Never claim more certainty than evidence supports.

2. **Operational Honesty**  
   If something is heuristic, say so.

3. **Auditable Ethics**  
   Ethics that cannot be inspected are indistinguishable from control.

---

## 🧠 Why These Limits Matter

Most AI safety failures originate from:
- overstated guarantees
- vague claims
- blurred boundaries between research and deployment

SUP3RA VECTRA™ chooses the opposite path:
> Fewer promises. Stronger guarantees where they exist.

---

## 🤝 Invitation to Critique

These limits are **not final**.

We actively invite:
- challenges to these boundaries
- empirical falsification
- proposals for expanding or refining scope

Criticism is not hostility — it is part of the governance loop.
