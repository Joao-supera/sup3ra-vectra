# Repository Structure Rationale

This repository is intentionally verbose.

## Why?
Ethical systems fail when:
- assumptions are implicit
- governance is centralized
- documentation is collapsed

## Each File Has One Responsibility
- SPEC.md → formal definition
- GOVERNANCE_MANUAL.md → ethical rules
- FAILURE_MODEL.md → where it breaks
- AUDITOR_OVERVIEW.md → compliance
- FOR_RESEARCHERS.md → reproducibility

## Result
- No hidden logic
- No interpretive gaps
- No “trust us” sections
