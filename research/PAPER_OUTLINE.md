# SUP3RA VECTRA™ — Paper Outline

## Title
Runtime Ethical Governance for Large Language Models Without Retraining

## Abstract
We introduce a runtime ethical governance framework that operates independently of model architecture and training data, enabling explicit ethical constraints and deterministic failure behavior.

## Sections
1. Introduction
2. Limitations of Training-Time Alignment
3. Runtime Governance as a Separate Layer
4. SUP3RA VECTRA™ Architecture
5. Honest Halt Protocol (HHP)
6. Empirical Validation Across 6 LLMs
7. Failure Analysis
8. Comparison with Constitutional AI
9. Limitations
10. Future Work

## Contributions
- Runtime ethics formalization
- Anti-anthropomorphism enforcement
- Deterministic failure handling
- Cross-model validation
